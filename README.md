- Express
- MongoDB
- Mongoose
- ReactJS
- Canva
- The Strain API
- Trello
- VS Code

## Getting Started

Go to **[flwr] (https://flwr-app.herokuapp.com/).**

## How to Use flwr

Sign up or log in to begin finding and adding rare strains.

## Next Steps
### *Bugs*

The http url of the API causes a mixed content error. The user must allow content that is not secure on their web browser before the strains render.

The unordered lists of strains arenn't fully aligned/centered.

The next feature to build is sending text notifications to users as an admin/dispensary owner. While I started writing the code to initiate this feature, I wasn't able to move past the errors and complete it.

### *Build On!*

Change the API to a secure API.
